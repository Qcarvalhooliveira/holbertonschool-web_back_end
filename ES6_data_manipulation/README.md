# **ES6 data manipulation** :computer:

## **Description** ::speech_balloon:

* ES6 data manipulation refers to the practice of using the features and enhancements introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to handle and transform data in JavaScript. ES6 brought significant improvements to the language, offering new methods and syntax for working with data structures, functions, and asynchronous operations.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays
* Typed arrays
* The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

## **Tasks:** :books:

#### **0. Basic list of objects**

* Create a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.

#### **1. More mapping**

* Create a function getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of object.

#### **2. Filter**

* Create a function getStudentsByLocation that returns an array of objects who are located in a specific city.

#### **3. Reduce**

* Create a function getStudentIdsSum that returns the sum of all the student ids.

#### **4. Combine**

* Create a function updateStudentGradeByCity that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grade

#### **5. Typed Arrays**

* Create a function named createInt8TypedArray that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position.

#### **6. Set data structure**

* Create a function named setFromArray that returns a Set from an array.

#### **7. More set data structure**

* Create a function named hasValuesFromArray that returns a boolean if all the elements in the array exist within the set.

#### **8. Clean set**

* Create a function named cleanSet that returns a string of all the set values that start with a specific string (startString).

#### **9. Map data structure**

* Create a function named groceriesList that returns a map of groceries with the following items (name, quantity):

#### **10. More map data structure**

* Create a function named updateUniqueItems that returns an updated map for all items with initial quantity at 1.
