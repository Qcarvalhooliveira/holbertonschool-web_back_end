# **Unittests in JS** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* Unit testing in JavaScript involves writing small, automated tests to verify individual units of code, typically functions or methods, within a JavaScript application. These tests aim to ensure that each unit performs as expected under various conditions, thereby catching bugs early, improving code quality, and facilitating safe refactoring. JavaScript offers several frameworks and libraries, like Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine, to simplify the process by providing tools for defining test cases, grouping tests, and mocking dependencies. This methodology is crucial for developing reliable, maintainable, and robust applications, fitting well with agile development practices by allowing quick and frequent test executions.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* How to use Mocha to write a test suite
* How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)
* How to present long test suites
* When and how to use spies
* When and how to use stubs
* What are hooks and when to use them
* Unit testing with Async functions
* How to write integration tests with a small node server
