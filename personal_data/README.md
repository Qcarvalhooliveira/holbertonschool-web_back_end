# **Personal Data** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identifiable individual. This can include information such as names, email addresses, identification numbers, location data, and online identifiers. It also extends to factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person. Essentially, if the information can directly or indirectly identify a person, it's considered personal data. The definition and protection of personal data are central to privacy laws and regulations around the world, such as the GDPR in the European Union, which aim to safeguard individuals' rights regarding their personal information.
