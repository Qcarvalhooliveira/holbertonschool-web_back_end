# **Session Authentication** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* Session authentication is a method used in web applications to manage user sessions through the server. When a user logs in, the server creates a session for that user, which is then stored either on the server itself or in a database. A session ID, a unique identifier for the session, is sent to the user's browser, typically in the form of a cookie. This session ID is sent back to the server with each subsequent request, allowing the server to recognize the user and maintain the state of their session. This method is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in maintaining user state across multiple requests, providing a seamless experience as users navigate through a web application.
