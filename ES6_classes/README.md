# **ES6 classes** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* ES6 classes are a new syntax for defining classes in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). They provide a more structured and convenient way to create constructor functions and manage object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance. ES6 classes make it easier to write and organize code, resembling class-based languages, even though JavaScript is primarily prototype-based. They include features like constructors, methods, inheritance using extends, and static methods, bringing a more familiar class-oriented programming style to JavaScript developers.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* How to define a Class
* How to add methods to a class
* Why and how to add a static method to a class
* How to extend a class from another
* Metaprogramming and symbols
