# **Queuing System in JS** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* A queuing system in JavaScript is a method for managing asynchronous tasks by organizing them in a sequence for execution, crucial for handling operations like API calls and file reading efficiently. JavaScript's event loop manages task queuing to some extent, but complex scenarios may require custom logic to prioritize tasks, limit concurrent executions, or batch process groups of tasks. These systems ensure tasks execute in the correct order, prevent race conditions, manage resource load, and enhance application efficiency.
