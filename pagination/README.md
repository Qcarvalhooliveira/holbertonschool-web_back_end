# **Pagination** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* Pagination in programming refers to the process of dividing a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. This is commonly used in applications and websites that display lists of information, such as search results, product listings, or social media feeds, where showing all the data at once would be impractical and overwhelming.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
* How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
* How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## **Tasks** :books:

#### **0. Simple helper function**

* Write a function named index_range that takes two integer arguments page and page_size.

#### **1. Simple pagination**

* Copy index_range from the previous task and the following class into your code.

#### **2. Hypermedia pagination**

* Replicate code from the previous task.

#### **3. Deletion-resilient hypermedia pagination**

* The goal here is that if between two queries, certain rows are removed from the dataset, the user does not miss items from dataset when changing page.
