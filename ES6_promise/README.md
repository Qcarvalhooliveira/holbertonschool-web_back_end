# **ES6 Promises** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* ES6 Promises, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), are a built-in feature in JavaScript that provide a standardized way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises represent a future result of an asynchronous operation, allowing you to define success and error handling with a cleaner and more readable syntax than traditional callback-based approaches. They have three states: pending, fulfilled (resolved), and rejected.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* Promises (how, why, and what)
* How to use the then, resolve, catch methods
* How to use every method of the Promise object
* Throw / Try
* The await operator
* How to use an async function

## **Tasks:** :books:

#### **0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep**

* Return a Promise using this prototype function getResponseFromAPI()

#### **1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it**

* Using the prototype below, return a promise. The parameter is a boolean.

#### **2. Catch me if you can!**

* Using the function prototype below

#### **3. Handle multiple successful promises**

* In this file, import uploadPhoto and createUser from utils.js

#### **4. Simple promise**

* Using the following prototype

function signUpUser(firstName, lastName) {
}

#### **5. Reject the promises**

* Write and export a function named uploadPhoto. It should accept one argument fileName (string).

#### **6. Handle multiple promises**

* Import signUpUser from 4-user-promise.js and uploadPhoto from 5-photo-reject.js.

#### **7. Load balancer**

* Write and export a function named loadBalancer. It should accept two arguments chinaDownload (Promise) and USDownload (Promise).

#### **8. Throw error / try catch**

* Write a function named divideFunction that will accept two arguments: numerator (Number) and denominator (Number).

#### **9. Throw an error**

* Write a function named guardrail that will accept one argument mathFunction (Function).
