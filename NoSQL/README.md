# **NoSQL** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* NoSQL, which stands for "Not Only SQL," is a type of database management system that diverges from the traditional relational database model. Unlike relational databases, which use structured tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and offer more flexibility in data storage and retrieval.
