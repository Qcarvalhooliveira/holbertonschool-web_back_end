# **Python - Variable Annotations** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* Variable annotations in Python involve specifying the expected type of a variable using type hints. These hints provide information about the data type the variable should hold, enhancing code readability and assisting static analysis tools. Although variable annotations are optional, they aid in conveying intentions clearly and can be valuable for documentation and maintaining code quality.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy

## **Tasks:** :books:

#### **0. Basic annotations - add**

* Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

#### **1. Basic annotations - concat**

* Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string

#### **2. Basic annotations - floor**

* Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.

#### **3. Basic annotations - to string**

* Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

#### **4. Define variables**

* Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:

#### **5. Complex types - list of floats**

* Write a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

#### **6. Complex types - mixed list**

* Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

#### **7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple**

* Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.

#### **8. Complex types - functions**

* Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.

#### **9. Let's duck type an iterable object**

* Annotate the below functionâ€™s parameters and return values with the appropriate types
