# **I18n** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* I18n stands for "internationalization," a process that makes your application adaptable to different languages and regions without engineering changes. The term comes from the fact that there are 18 letters between the 'i' and the 'n' in "internationalization." Internationalization involves designing and developing your software in a way that makes it easy to adapt to various languages and regions by extracting text strings and other locale-specific components (like date, time, and currency formats) into configurable files. This enables you to support multiple languages and cultural norms without modifying the underlying codebase, making your application globally accessible.
