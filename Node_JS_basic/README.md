# **NodeJS Basics** :computer:

## **Description:** 

* Node.js Basics refer to the foundational concepts and fundamental knowledge required to get started with Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. This includes understanding how Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, which enables non-blocking (asynchronous) operations, making it efficient for building scalable network applications like web servers. The basics also cover the use of npm (Node Package Manager) for managing libraries and dependencies, understanding core modules (e.g., http, fs, path, and events) that provide essential functionalities for application development, handling asynchronous programming patterns (callbacks, promises, and async/await), and creating simple applications to grasp how Node.js can be used for server-side scripting, REST APIs, and interacting with databases. Additionally, understanding the event loop and the non-blocking nature of Node.js operations is crucial for beginners to effectively utilize its features for building fast, scalable network applications.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* run javascript using NodeJS
* use NodeJS modules
* use specific Node JS module to read files
* use process to access command line arguments and the environment
* create a small HTTP server using Node JS
* create a small HTTP server using Express JS
* create advanced routes with Express JS
* use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
* use Nodemon to develop faster

## **Tasks** :books:

#### **0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS**

* In the file 0-console.js, create a function named displayMessage that prints in STDOUT the string argument.

#### **1. Using Process stdin**

* Create a program named 1-stdin.js that will be executed through command line.

#### **2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS**

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 2-read_file.js

#### **3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS**

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 3-read_file_async.js

#### **4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**

* In a file named 4-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module

#### **5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**

* In a file named 5-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module

#### **6. Create a small HTTP server using Express**

* Install Express and in a file named 6-http_express.js, create a small HTTP server using Express module

#### **7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express**

* In a file named 7-http_express.js, recreate the small HTTP server using Express

#### **8. Organize a complex HTTP server using Express**

Obviously writing every part of a server within a single file is not sustainable. Let’s create a full server in a directory named full_server.

Since you have used ES6 and Babel in the past projects, let’s use babel-node to allow to use ES6 functions like import or export.

* 8.1 Organize the structure of the server
* 8.2 Write the App controller
* 8.3 Write the Students controller
* 8.4 Write the routes
* 8.5 Write the server reusing everything you created
* 8.6 Update package.json (if you are running it from outside the folder full_server)
