# **Python - Async Comprehension** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* Async Comprehension in Python refers to the ability to use asynchronous operations within a comprehension construct. Comprehensions are concise ways to create lists, dictionaries, or other data structures in Python. With the introduction of asynchronous programming using the async and await keywords, Python also allows asynchronous operations to be combined with comprehensions.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

## **Tasks** :books:

#### **0. Async Generator**

* Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

#### **1. Async Comprehensions**

* Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

#### **2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions**

* Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.
